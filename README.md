# IF-Condition

The dataset provides simple details about employees, such as names, departments, regions, payment methods, revenue, profit, and profit margin. There's a "Bonus" column initially left empty. Using an If function, I've set a rule: if an employee made more than $5,000, they get a bonus; if less, they receive training. This straightforward approach helps identify high performers for bonuses and provides training opportunities for those who need improvement, making use of the If function to automate the decision process.
